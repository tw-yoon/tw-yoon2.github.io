                <strong>Logo Redesign</strong>
                <br><br>
                Ever since I joined Northwestern's Korean American Student Association (KASA) last year as a freshman, I
                wanted to redesign the <span class="hover-trigger">logo</span>
                <span class="hover-image">
                    <img src="kasa/kasa2022.png" alt="KASA Logo 2022" style="width: 100px;">
                    <!-- Adjust the src and style as needed -->
                </span> of the club. I liked how the club had a new concept and new logo every year, but I thought the
                previous logo did not represent the club and promote Korean culture well enough.
                <br><br>
                This is the new logo for the club. The final design of the logo infuses typography: the logo can be read
                in both English and Korean. If you look on the left side of each letter (and if you can read Korean), it
                says “KASA” in Korean (카사). It’s a subtle detail that might be hard to catch, but that is
                the main design aspect and what I like most about the logo. The colors are from the Korean flag - red,
                blue, and black on white background. The letter “S” is modified to symbolize the <span
                    class="hover-trigger">"Taegeuk"</span>
                <span class="hover-image">
                    <img src="kasa/taegeuk.png" alt="KASA Logo 2022" style="width: 100px;">
                    <!-- Adjust the src and style as needed -->
                </span>
                pattern shown in the center of the Korean flag. (Hover <span class="hover-trigger">here</span>

                <strong>Character Design</strong>
                <br><br>
                In KASA, we have three “families,” or small in-club groups with names based on ancient Korean countries:
                Baekje, Silla and Goguryeo. As the publicity chair, I thought that the best way to increase club
                participation was by designing cute little characters for these groups. But I didn't want them to just
                be cute; I wanted them to also have a
                cultural contribution for the club.
                <br><br>
                These are the three characters that represent the club: Bingsoo for Baekje, Saida for Silla, and Goguma
                for Goguryeo. They are named after Korean food that start with the same initials as the groups. The
                colors yellow, blue, and red are from the flag colors of these ancient countries, and the fancy
                ornaments they have on their heads are famous <span class="hover-trigger">artifacts</span>
                <span class="hover-image">

                from their motif country.
                <br><br>
                They went through a huge facelift - if you see the very first <span class="hover-trigger">designs</span>

                of the characters you won’t even recognize them. I had weekly meetings with the club presidents to
                confirm the design throughout summer break.

                Now that I have a logo and characters, what to do next? The logos and characters were used for all
                of the posts that got uploaded to the KASA Instagram page. Family event posts have their respective
                character in the post, and official club announcements have a uniformed format with the same font,
                same background. The motif for the background for club announcement posts were luxury brands, such
                as
                <span class="hover-trigger">Louis Vuitton </span>
                <span class="hover-image">

                </span>
                </span>and
                <span class="hover-trigger">Fendi</span>
                <span class="hover-image">
                    <img src="kasa/Asset 11.png" alt="KASA Logo 2022" style="width: 100px;">
                </span>, having repeated patterns of their logo as a design aspect.
