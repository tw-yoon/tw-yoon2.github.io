                <strong>Project Summary</strong>
                <br><br>
                The Northwestern Formula SAE team builds a new car every year.I was assigned to the suspension team, and
                was in charge of the steering system along with two other senior members. Manufacturing the steering
                columns and pillow blocks were my first individual project for the team.
                <br><br>
                The goal of this project was to ensure that the steering columns and pillow blocks were designed and
                fabricated to exact standards so that the parts fit perfectly into the vehicle's cockpit. Through this
                project, I aimed to establish a foundation for engineering with precision and collaborative
                problem-solving. As a team, we set a goal to improve from last year’s design, focusing on removing play
                in the steering.
                <br><br>
                I started by accurately measuring the angle and distance of the steering columns to ensure a seamless
                fit within the cockpit's limited space. In order to do so, we as a team chose to use a different u-joint
                that has a bigger angle mobility compared to last year. The pillow blocks were also redesigned; the new
                design has a 33% reduced weight compared to last year’s design. Following this, I carefully manufactured
                the parts using a lathe and a mill to machine the pieces to the required specifications.
                <br><br>
                Through rigorous measurement and precise machining, we achieved an optimal fit within the cockpit,
                ensuring both functionality and ergonomic comfort for the driver. All of the components in the steering
                system were welded together, to ensure that there was no play in the system. If I were to redo the 
                project again, I would like to manufacture the pillow blocks using the CNC mill for precision and 
                a more optimal design.
