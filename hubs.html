                <strong>Project Summary</strong>
                <br><br>
                In my second project for the Formula SAE team, I decided to be in charge of the rear hubs and hub caps,
                because I wanted to learn how to operate the CNC mill. This project would heavily rely on precise CAD
                modeling and CAM operations, something that I have never done before.
                <br><br>
                Over the summer, I worked on the initial design phase using Solidworks while having biweekly Zoom
                meetings with Cameron, the suspension team leader. The initial CAD model then went through a rigorous
                refinement process throughout the fall quarter, facilitated by the guidance of Cameron. The main focus in 
                this stage was peforming finite element analysis; crucial to ensure the structural integrity of the part 
                in multiple driving situations. The testing was done for four cases: outside cornering, inside cornering,
                braking, and accelerating, which all passed with a large factor of safety.
                This collaborative effort also included working alongside Benji, who was responsible for the design of the
                front hubs, ensuring coherence and functionality across the vehicle's design.
                <br><br>
                By the end of the fall quarter, the design for the rear hubs was finalized, scheduled to be manufactured
                in winter break. Due to the complexity of the part and given the limitations of our school's facilities,
                which lacked a 5-axis CNC mill, we opted to outsource the manufacturing of the rear hubs. In order to do
                so, I made a geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing sheet to send over to the manufacturer.
                <br><br>
                However, the hub caps presented an opportunity for hands-on experience with CNC milling within our
                school's capabilities. Utilizing Fusion 360 for CAM, I prepared the hub caps for manufacturing, which
                happened during the winter quarter.
                <br><br>
                This project not only challenged my technical skills but also honed my ability to navigate the
                complexities of collaborative design and the intricacies of manufacturing processes. With this project I
                became confident in designing using a computer aided design software and operating the CNC milling
                machine.
