                <strong>Project Summary</strong>
                <br><br>
                I was part of a four-member team focused on a project designed to assist individuals with mobility
                challenges. Our mission was to create a device that improves the grocery shopping experience for our
                client, <span class="hover-trigger">Judy Geigner</span>.

                <br><br>
                Mrs. Giegner, a senior citizen grappling with Parkinson’s and osteoarthritis, faced difficulties in
                bending down, raising her arms above her shoulders, and executing complex hand movements. However,
                despite her medical conditions, she independently managed her weekly grocery shopping and wanted to
                continue doing it as it was one of her favorite hobbies.
                <br><br>
                Understanding her needs led us to develop the “Cart With Basket,” specifically engineered to facilitate
                easy transfer of groceries from her car trunk to her tabletop, which had different heights. To
                accommodate Mrs. Giegner’s mobility restrictions, we focused on creating a solution that minimized her
                need to bend down or reach high. Our final result was a cart crafted from mainly PVC pipes, featuring a
                linear actuator that allowed for height adjustments between 28 and 44 inches, ensuring precise and easy
                control and accessibility for the targeted heights.
                <br><br>
                Working under a budget of $150, we successfully created a fully functioning prototype. In the end of the
                quarter, we presented this prototype to Mrs. Giegner.

                <strong>Major Features</strong>
                <br><br>
                1. Openable side with velcro locks
                <br><br>
                A basket requires up and down hand movement. Since our client could not carry heavy groceries and raise
                them up vertically, we needed to find an easy but effective way to load and unload groceries. To solve
                this issue, we decided to replace one side of the basket and make it open. The openable side would be
                then fastened using four big lengthy velcro straps, as they are easy to open and close without any
                complex hand movement.
                <br><br>
                Our initial mockup had an opening in the front side of the cart, with a roller so that the opening side
                acts as a ramp to elevate the groceries to a higher position. However, after having a meeting with the
                client, we moved the opening side to the left side of the cart based on her preference. The ramp idea
                was also not used as the linear actuator solved the height problem.
                <br><br>
                2. U-shaped handles
                <br><br>
                Our team decided to improve the handle: instead of only having the straight bar a normal shopping cart
                would have, we decided to add vertical handles on each side, creating an unique inverse U-shaped handle.
                This shape helps the client push the cart up a ramp as it provides a more stable grip. The handle was
                wrapped with rubber grip tape for comfort and safety.
                <br><br>
                3. Adjustable height using linear actuator
                <br><br>
                The client's car trunk and the tabletop had a difference in height of 10 inches. The client
                wanted a non-complicated device that would assist her moving groceries up to her tabletop.
                <br><br>
                Despite the client's preference, we ended up
                using a linear actuator. It was for two reasons: first, a mechanical lift would increase the weight of
                the cart. This will make it hard for our client to load the cart into her car. Second, the locking
                mechanism to hold the mechanical lift at a certain height would require bending down and complex hand
                movements, which the client would’ve felt uncomfortable with her medical conditions. A linear actuator,
                on the other hand, only operates with a switch, toggling up and down, with a downside of having to change
                batteries every once in a while.
                <br><br>
                4. Locking wheels
                <br><br>
                In order for the client to move her groceries from her car to her tabletop, she had to walk up a
                ramp and open a door. The locking wheels fix the cart on the ramp while she opens her door.
